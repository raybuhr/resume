| Braintree, A PayPal Service | Data Scientist 2        | December 2018 - present |

***Braintree*** builds tools to help businesses accept payments across the globe.

At Braintree, I helped lead the Data Research team to innovate and build analytical solutions to our most pressing business needs. We explored problems like fraud and anomaly detection, customer retention, financial forecasting, and causal inference within payment flows. I served as the machine learning expert for new product initiatives.

**Churn**

-   Inherited a project 6 months in with very little progress and was able to turn it into a batch prediction job that led to the successful intervention and retention of multiple enterprise customers that our account management team did not know had already started to look at other solutions.
-   A/B tested multiple algorithms against each other, but picked the one that was easiest to explain the predictors (Logistic Regression) rather than the most accurate (Neural Network) so that our account managers could have context going into calls with the customers predicted most likely to churn.

**Dispute Evidence Recommendations**

- Paired with disputes feature engineering team to build a NLP pipeline to categorize evidence and a logistic regression model to predict likelihood of a merchant winning a chargeback dispute, with estimated impact of 5-30% improvements in win rate for most merchants (potentially saving them millions per year).
- Deployed models to production using AWS Sagemaker, Kubernetes, and Redis. 
- Partnered with Customer Success team to identify over 200 customers to pilot launch for and setup reporting and dashboard for tracking success.

***Pangea Money Transfer*** offers web and mobile apps that allow people in the U.S. to easily send money to friends and family in 15 countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia.

At Pangea, I initiated and led efforts to build out a data warehouse from scratch, revamp our BI platform, analyze and remodel our pricing, design and evalute experiments (A/B tests) for product and marketing campaigns, and integrate dynamic data feeds into our CRM platform for more personalized messaging.

***Raise*** is an online gift card marketplace where you can sell gift cards for cash or buy discounted gift cards to all your favorite brands.

At Raise, I built data pipelines from multiple production relational databases and external vendors, used statistics to describe and explain trends and distributions in marketplace behavior, and modeled dynamic relationships impacting risk and finance using machine learning techniques.

**Lead Scoring**

-   Enhanced data from CRM (Salesforce) and transactional database (MySQL) with data from US Census Bureau and other demographics vendors, then fed into a Random Forest classifier trained to segment leads by probability to convert.
-   The revamped lead scoring method for the sales team led to easier identification of which prospects could be more easily converted and resulted in 50% reduction in unsuccessful phone calls and thus increased time in the day for new lead generation.

**Brand Associations**

-   Used association rules and apriori algorithm to cluster brands together by which other brands their customers also purchased.
-   Automated data pipeline and dashboard of results for marketing team, which enabled on demand email campaigns and enhanced conversion rate 5-10x (by brand) over previous strategy obtained from external consultants.
